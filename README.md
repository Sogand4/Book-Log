# Book Log

This application allows the user to keep track of the books they have read. The user will be able to add, view, and
remove any books in the log. A book log is a useful tool for avid readers to keep a record of all the books they have
read. It can also encourage them to continue reading. This project interests me because I enjoy reading and would like
to have an application where I can keep track of what I have read.

## Phase 4: Task 3

Changes I would make given more time:

- Refactor BookLogGUI by taking out some of its nested classes and making them separate. I would do this because it
  would help with the readability of the program.
