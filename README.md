# Book Log

This application allows the user to keep track of the books they have read.
The user will be able to add, edit, and remove any books in the log.
A book log is a useful tool for avid readers to keep a record of all the books they have read.
It can also encourage them to continue reading.
This project interests me because I enjoy reading and would like to have an application
where I can keep track of what I have read.
